    "This notebook will closely follow examples described and given in Optimization Models in Electricity Markets by Anthony Papavasiliou. The purpose of this notebook is to gain experience and show how to use industry examples of this. The framework chosen for this is pyomo since it is the most well known free framework that can be used by anybody. It isn't ideal for matrices or vector constraints so they are not natively supported but still useful. "
